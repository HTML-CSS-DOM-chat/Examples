Radio & Checkboxes CSS
======================

This example provides a nice CSS styling for checkboxes and radio buttons in HTML.

Please note that this is **not cross browser compatible** because it relies on using the `:checked` CSS selector.
Browser support for this can be found in the MDN article. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked#Browser_compatibility
